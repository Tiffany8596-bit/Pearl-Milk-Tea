    <h2>Bubble Tea Started Here in Taiwan</h2>

    <div class="history">

        <div class="history-text">
            <p>Back in the late 1980s, a little tea shop in Taichung, Taiwan, called Chun Shui Tang, tried something
                new. They decided to mix their creamy milk tea with chewy little tapioca pearls, just to see what would
                happen. People loved it! The drink was fun to sip, sweet and creamy, with the pearls giving it a playful
                twist. And just like that, bubble tea was born.</p>
            <p>Over time, this fun little invention started to spread. People told their friends about it, other tea
                shops tried making it too, and before long, bubble tea became something everyone wanted to try. More and
                more brands popped up, and eventually, it grew beyond Taiwan, reaching tea lovers all around the world.

            <p>From carefully selected teas to freshly cooked pearls, every step is made with dedication. We blend
                flavors with precision, so each sip is rich, refreshing, and filled with heart. Behind every cup lies
                patience and passion, from the warmth of brewing, the rhythm of shaking, to the joy of serving.</p>

                <p>Each tea has its own taste. Green tea is light and fresh, black tea is bold, oolong is smooth, and
                    Tieguanyin has a warm roasted flavour. </p>

                <p>The pearls are made with cassava starch and cooked with care. They kept fresh and soft, best enjoyed
                    within a few hours for the perfect chew.</p>

            <p>These days, bubble tea has grown way beyond its original form. It's not just milk tea with pearls
                anymore, you will find fruity blends, creamy taro, even coffee-inspired versions. And pearls? In Taiwan,
                people
                love getting creative with them. They show up in tofu pudding, shaved ice, or even tucked inside red
                bean
                cakes. Modern spins keep popping up tooâ€”pearl ice pops, pearl cakes, and honestly, pearls with matcha
                are
                such a perfect combo. It is fun to see how one little idea turned into so many delicious possibilities.
